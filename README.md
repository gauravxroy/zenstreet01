**Therapy App: User Flow Description**

The therapy app streamlines booking and managing therapy sessions through a user-friendly interface. Here's the flow for the "Book a Session" feature:

1. **Access Therapist Portfolio**:  
   Clients begin by visiting the therapist's portfolio page on Zenstreet. They click "Book a Session" to view therapy packages, durations, and pricing. If applicable, employer coverage details are displayed.



  ### Note : Features below are need to be developed , I need some time to do so , if you can give me some time till sunday EOD I will make it happen before that. 
2. **Session Package Selection**:  

   Clients select a package based on their needs and desired session duration (e.g., 30 min, 1 hour). Partnered employer discounts are highlighted, encouraging them to proceed.

3. **Slot Filtering & Selection**:  
   Clients filter slots by date or time, choosing between call, video, or in-person options. For in-person sessions, location details are provided. They pick a suitable slot and proceed.

4. **Booking Confirmation**:  
   Clients enter personal details and apply employer-provided codes, if available. The system validates the code, adjusts pricing accordingly, and generates an updated invoice. Payment is completed using an integrated gateway.

5. **Session Confirmation & Reminders**:  
   Booking details, including session type, timing, and location (if applicable), are emailed to the client. Zenstreet sends automated reminders 24 hours, 4 hours, and 1 hour before the session.

6. **Session Follow-Up**:  
   Online session links are shared for virtual appointments. After the session, clients rate the experience and provide feedback via follow-up emails.
